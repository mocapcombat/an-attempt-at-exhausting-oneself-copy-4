     This website came into existence from the collecting of images with an old Sony Cybershot that used to belong to my father. He explained to me that he had never used the camera because the image quality had not pleased him at the time. Due to this shortcoming he never decided to purchase an SD card for it, leaving it sitting with nothing but it’s 10MB internal storage. This allows for approximately 10 images to be taken.
The camera and the old SD card it requires, have since become obsolete.
I decided to use this camera as a restriction to myself, to only use this camera to take pictures with. Any time I wanted to take a new photo, I was forced to delete one.
